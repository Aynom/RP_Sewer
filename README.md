# RP_Sewer
<b> A storm sewer design tool </b>

This Java-based tool was implemented for use in storm sewer design analysis based on the following main concepts:    
  
<li> Peak runoff from selected design storm determines size of sewer pipe
<li> Area drained by each section of sewer estimated from shape file after delineating using an interactive viewer of the module
<li> A self cleansing velocity is maintained
<li> Flow velocity and pipe slope determined using Manning Equation
<li> Pipe diameter, flow velocity as well as excavation depths of each sewer section are some of the main outputs
