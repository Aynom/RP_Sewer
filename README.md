# RP_Sewer
<b> A storm sewer design tool </b>
  
<li> Peak runoff from selected design storm determines size of sewer pipe
<li> Area drained by each section of sewer estimated from shape file after delineating using an interactive viewer of the module
<li> A self cleansing velocity is maintained
<li> Flow velocity and pipe slope determined using Manning Eqn
<li> Pipe diameter, flow velocities as well as excavation depths of each sewer section are some of the main outputs
